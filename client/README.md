# Personal Finance Manager Client

This is the client-side application for the Personal Finance Manager project, designed to help users manage their finances with ease. Built with React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), this application provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Follow the instructions below to get started with the development and testing of the client-side application.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. This will allow you to install dependencies, run the available scripts, and start the development server.

### Installing

First, clone the main project repository and navigate to the `client` directory:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-finance-manager.git
cd personal-finance-manager/client

Install the project dependencies:

npm install

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production:

npm run build

This command optimizes the build for the best performance, creating the `build` folder ready for deployment.
